      - question: What if Scholared doesn't suit your needs?
        answer: >
          You can always cancel your subscription and you will be refunded on a
          pro-rata basis. But future applications for subscription will be
          considered with lower priority.
      - question: How is our privacy ensured?
        answer: >
          Given that our primary target market is tech startups/companies, we
          understand your need to protect your identity. Right from the media to
          investors, we have you covered. Talk to a customer representative to
          help you walk through our steps to protect your identity.
      - question: What if I want exclusivity?
        answer: >
          We take on very few customers and try to avoid overlap within our
          clientele. If you are building a law school study app for a region, we
          will not accept applications from clients operating in the same market
          of the same geographical region. As you start expanding and have more
          active users throughout the globe we are happy to restrict our
          services accordingly. We prefer to have long term mutually beneficial
          relationships.
